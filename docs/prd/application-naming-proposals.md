# Application Naming Proposals

**Status:** Draft - Under Review
**Created:** 2026-01-11
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-11

---

## Executive Summary

This document captures naming proposals for the photo-admin application rebrand. The current name "photo-admin" is functional but lacks market appeal and brand identity. These proposals aim to find a name that is:

- Memorable and catchy
- Evocative of photography
- Suggestive of workflow/organization/insights
- Professional and modern
- Available as a domain (ideally .com or .io)

---

## Application Value Proposition

Based on the [domain model](../domain-model.md), the application offers:

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Workflow Pipelines** | Directed graph processing from capture to archive |
| **Event Management** | Calendar-based shoot planning, logistics, attendance |
| **Multi-Storage Orchestration** | Unified management of local, S3, GCS, SMB storage |
| **Analytics & Insights** | Camera usage, workflow efficiency, bottleneck detection |
| **Subject Tracking** | Image-to-performer tagging with AI/ML assist potential |
| **Collection Analysis** | Orphan detection, sidecar validation, pattern analysis |

### Target Users

- Professional photographers (studio, event, sports/wildlife)
- Hobbyist photographers managing personal collections
- Photography teams sharing resources

### Competitive Landscape

[Snappr Workflows](https://www.snappr.com/workflows) targets enterprise content marketing teams with no-code automation. Our application is more **photographer-centric**, focusing on the individual/team photographer's workflow from event planning through final archive.

## Implementation Roadmap (Draft)

Once a name is selected, the following actions will be required to complete the rebrand.

| **Trademark search** | Verify no conflicts in software/photography space (USPTO, EUIPO) | Low |
| **Logo & branding** | Design logo, color palette, typography guidelines | Medium |
| **Social media handles** | Reserve accounts on GitHub, Twitter/X, LinkedIn, etc. | Low |

### Phase 2: Repository & Infrastructure

| Task | Description | Effort |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **GitHub repository rename** | Rename `fabrice-guiot/photo-admin` to new name | Low |
| **Update GitHub settings** | Description, topics, social preview image | Low |

### Phase 3: Codebase Updates

| Task | Description | Effort |
|------|-------------|--------|

| **API endpoints** | Review `/api/` paths for any app-name references | Low |
| **Frontend branding** | Update app title, favicon, meta tags, sidebar | Low |
| **CLI tool names** | Decide if tools keep names (photostats) or rebrand | Medium |

### Phase 4: Documentation Updates

| Task | Description | Effort |
|------|-------------|--------|

| **Git history** | Note: Historical commits will retain old name (acceptable) | - |
| **Redirect setup** | Configure old GitHub URL to redirect to new repo | Low |
| **Announcement** | Prepare changelog/release notes for rebrand | Low |

### Codebase Search Patterns

The following patterns should be searched and updated:

# Case-sensitive searches to perform
grep -r "photo-admin" .
grep -r "photo_admin" .
grep -r "PhotoAdmin" .
grep -r "PHOTO_ADMIN" .
grep -r "photoAdmin" .
```

### Files Likely Requiring Updates

| `Dockerfile` | Image names |

### Risk Considerations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **Broken links** | Set up GitHub redirects; update any external references |
| **Import errors** | Comprehensive test suite run after rename |
| **User confusion** | Clear announcement with migration guide |
| **SEO impact** | Minimal for internal tool; redirect old URLs |

### Estimated Total Effort

| Phase | Effort |
|-------|--------|
| Phase 1: Pre-Launch | 1-2 days |
